"""

Implements the BaseCoordinator from Charmhelpers on Operator Framework.


The OpsCoordinator subclasses Serial Coordinator. It masks the use of hookenv
primitives to deal with Juju and exposes Events and methods to the other
elements. This is possible because the BaseCoordinator does not use any of the
default files or unit databases to store its own state. Instead, it saves on
local file named: .charmhelpers.coordinator.OpsCoordinator. Therefore, no
conflicts are expected with the Operator Framework.

Also implements the RestartEvent. This event should be emitted
every time a restart is needed and will trigger the lock negotiation protocol
across the peer relation.

RestartEvent receives two arguments:
ctx: a dictionary containing current context when the RestartEvent was issued.
     this variable is not used in the restart logic itself, it is intended to
     let the user optionally update its own context once the restart has been
     done.

services: a list of strings. It is the list of services to be restarted.

It is important to understand that RestartEvent only restarts systemd services
using the service_restart from Charmhelpers.

There is also an option to add a callback function in the coordinator. That
allows the charm to report back after a restart, e.g. if it needs to share
data across a relation after successful restart.



HOW TO IMPLEMENT IT ON YOUR CHARM - BASICS:

            # if the service is actually functional. If yes, then let restart
            # processing follow its normal path and drop the remaining events.
            # Otherwise, it needs to take a different route. In this example,
            # it will simply defer the event, but it could as well abandon
            # it and block the unit with "restart failed", so the operator
            # can be warned and take a counter-measure.
